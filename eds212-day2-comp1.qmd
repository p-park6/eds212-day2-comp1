# Derivatives in R

```{r}
#first create an expression
fx = expression(3.1 * (x ^ 4) - 28 *x)
#expression is now stored
df_dx<-D(fx, 'x')    #this line will find the derivative, and this is being stored on df_dx
df_dx   #this will show me what df_dx is
```

```{r}
#asking what the slope is at x=10
x <- 10
eval(df_dx)   #will evaluate the slope with x=10
```

## Find the Slope for g(z)= 2z^3^ - 10.5z^2^ +4.1 at z=3.6

```{r}
gz <- expression(2*z^3 - 10.5*z^2 +4.1)
#expression is made and stored
df_dz <- D(gz, 'z')
#derivative is made and can be found
df_dz
#show derivative
z <- 3.6
#z is now stored with a value
eval(df_dz)
#slope is found
```

```{r}
#finding a derivative over a sequence of values
gz <- expression(2*z^3 - 10.5*z^2 +4.1)
#expression is made and stored
df_dz <- D(gz, 'z')
#derivative is made and can be found
df_dz
#show derivative
z <- seq(from=1,to=3,length=20)
#z is now stored with sequence of values
eval(df_dz)
#slope is found
```

this has been a change

this is another change
